### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rosalie and I started in July 2021 a postdoc at the iEES-Paris (FR). I will be working on characterizing the metabolism in experimental ponds, located south of Paris (France).  
Previously, I was working at the University of Vermont (US), I am working on two projects. The first project's objectives are to understand how the emergence of invasive fish species and stocking decisions are impacting the food web of Lake Champlain. I am using Ecopath to build a food web model and test different scenarios to inform the lake fisheries. We found that different basins of Lake Champlain, despite being connected, show different level of vulnerability to species invasion, notably due to the differences in oxythermal habitat and resource subsidies. The second project is a contribution to the international group [GEISHA Storm-blitz](https://www.geisha-stormblitz.fr), whose objectives are to better characterize the impacts of storms on the physical habitat of lakes and phytoplankton assemblages. I am investigating how the average phytoplankton traits changes across different types of lakes (more or less stormy).
